### Requirements:

- **Bagisto**: v2.3.0

---

### Installation:

To install the Bagisto GraphQL API, follow these steps:

1. **Install via Composer**

   Run the following command in your terminal to install the GraphQL API package:

   ```bash
   composer require bagisto/graphql-api:v2.3.2
   ```

2. **Update Middleware Configuration**

   In your `bootstrap/app.php` file, add the following session middleware changes:

   ```php
   use Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession;
   use Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse;

   return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
      ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
         // ... rest of middleware setup

         /**
          * Remove session and cookie middleware from the 'web' middleware group.
          */
         $middleware->removeFromGroup('web', [StartSession::class, AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class]);

         /**
          * Adding session and cookie middleware globally to apply across non-web routes (e.g. GraphQL)
          */
         $middleware->append([StartSession::class, AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class]);
      })
      // ... rest of configuration
   ```

   This ensures that session and cookie middleware are applied globally across all routes, including API and GraphQL endpoints.

3. **Update Environment Settings**

   Add the following entries to your `.env` file to configure JWT settings:

   ```env
   JWT_TTL=525600
   JWT_SHOW_BLACKLIST_EXCEPTION=true
   ```

4. **Publish Assets and Configurations**

   Run the command below to publish assets and configurations for Bagisto GraphQL:

   ```bash
   php artisan bagisto-graphql:install
   ```

### Usage:

1. **GraphQL Playground**

   After installation, you can test your API through the GraphQL Playground. Visit:

   ```
   http://your-domain.com/graphiql
   ```

2. **Postman Integration**

   Alternatively, you can test the API using Postman by accessing:

   ```
   http://your-domain.com/graphql
   ```
3. **Authorization**

   To authorize requests for certain APIs, you may need to provide the `MOBIKUL_API_KEY`. 

   1. **Locate the API Key**

      Find the `MOBIKUL_API_KEY` in your `.env` file:

      ```env
      MOBIKUL_API_KEY=your-mobikul-api-key
      ```

   2. **Share with App Development Team**

      Copy this key and securely share it with the Development team as required for API authorization.

   3. **Using the API Key**

      When making requests to protected admin endpoints, include the API key in the request headers:

      ```
      MOBIKUL_API_KEY: your-mobikul-api-key
      ```

      Replace `your-mobikul-api-key` with the actual value from your `.env` file.

4. **GraphQL Playground Endpoint Configuration**

   Ensure that the `GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` in your `.env` file is set to your application's URL followed by `/graphiql`. For example:

   ```env
   GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=https://your-domain.com/graphiql
   ```
